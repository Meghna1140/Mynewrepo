# Mynewrepo
# 🚀 First GitHub Project

This is my first GitHub repository created to begin my journey in coding and software development. Through this project, I am learning the basics of version control, improving consistency, and practicing fundamental programming concepts. I will continue updating and refining this repository as I grow my skills. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
